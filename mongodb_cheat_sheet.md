# Aggregation (pipeline operations)

Group values from multiple documents together. Â· Perform operations on the grouped data to return a single result.

Aggregation process has several steps that transform data in some way. The output of first step is act as input for next step, the same process goes on until the final result produced

syntax:
db.collection.aggregate(pipeline as [], options)

## Databases

Example: Finds the teachers whose gender is male

```shell
db.t_info.aggregate([
  {$match: {gender: "Male"}}
])
```

Example: Group teachers by age

```shell
db.t_info.aggregate([
  {$group: {_id: "$age"}}
])
```

Example: Group teachers by age and show all teachers name per age group

```shell
db.t_info.aggregate([
  {$group: {_id: "$age", names: {$push: "$name"} }}
])
```

since the names field use $push operator to add name field from each document to an array

Example: Group teachers by age and show all teachers documents per age group

```shell
db.t_info.aggregate([
  {$group: {_id: "$age", poraDoc: {$push: "$$ROOT"} }}
])
```

$$ROOT is a reference to complete current document ,since the names field use $push operator to add poraDoc from each document to an array.

Example: Group teachers by age and show all teachers documents per age group and count

```shell
db.t_info.aggregate([
  {$group: {_id: "$age", poraDoc: {$push: "$$ROOT"}, count: {$sum: 1} }}
])
```

Example: Give a count per age male teacher

```shell
db.t_info.aggregate([
  {$match: {gender: "Male"}},
  {$group: {_id: "$age", count: {$sum: 1} }}
])
```

The value of $sum, for each document in a group, the value count is increment by 1 in a group document

Example: Give a count per age of female teacher and sort them in desc order

```shell
db.t_info.aggregate([
  {$match: {gender: "Female"}},
  {$group: {_id: "$age", count: {$sum: 1}}},
  {$sort: {count: -1}}
])
```

    Example: Give a count per age of female teacher, sort them in desc order and find max number of female teacher having same age and return that group

```shell
db.t_info.aggregate([
  {$match: {gender: "Female"}},
  {$group: {_id: "$age", count: {$sum: 1}}},
  {$sort: {count: -1}},
  {$group: {_id: null, maxCount:{$max: "$count"}}}
])
```

## $unwind operator is used to deconstruct an array field in a document and create separate output documents for each item in the array.

    Example: Group teachers by age and show hobbies of a teacher within a group as an single array

```shell
db.t_info.aggregate([
  {$unwind: "$hobbies"},
  {$group: {_id: "$age", hobbiesArray: {$addToSet: "$hobbies"}}},
  {$sort: {_id: 1}}
])
```

## Example: No of teachers per each hobbies

```shell
db.t_info.aggregate([
  {$unwind: "$hobbies"},
  {$group: {_id: "$hobbies", count: {$sum: 1}}}
])
```

## Example: Avg age of teachers in a single document

```shell
db.t_info.aggregate([
    {$unwind: "$hobbies"},
  {$group: {_id: null, averageAge: {$avg: "$age"}}}
])
```

\_id: null in $group operator means all the document will be grouped together in a single collection

## Example: Find total number of hobbies for all teachers in a single document

```shell
db.t_info.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$hobbies" },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      uniqueHobbies: { $addToSet: "$hobbies" }
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      count: { $size: "$uniqueHobbies" }
      }
  }
])
```

# lookup in Aggregation (pipeline operations)

$lookup is an aggregation pipeline stage that allow you to perform a left outer join between two collections

syntax:
db.collection.aggregate( [
{
$lookup: {
from: "",
localField: "",
foreignField: "",
as: ""
}
}
], options)

```shell
Customer Collection:
{
  "_id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe"
},

{
  "_id": 2,
  "name": "Jane Smith"
}
Order Collection:
{
  "_id": 101,
  "product": "Smartphone",
  "customerid": 1
}

{
  "_id": 102,
  "product": "Laptop",
  "customerid": 2
}

{
  "_id": 103,
  "product": "Tablet",
  "customerid": 3  // This customer ID doesn't match any existing customer
}
```

```shell
db.customer.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup:{
      from: "order",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "customerid",
      as: "customerOrders"

    }
  }
])
```
